# image-documents-segmentation# Image Documents Segmentation

Segmentation of image documents based on machine learning.

## Overview

Image document segmentation is a key task in the field of computer vision. It involves dividing an image into distinct regions or components to extract specific information. This project aims to develop a system based on machine learning or deep learning capable of segmenting an image document into different areas such as:

- Images  
- Image captions  
- Headers and footers  
- Section headers  
- Text boxes  
- List items  

Additionally, the project proposes a user interface to visualize the results of the segmentation, making it easier to analyze and interpret the segmented components.
